# Functional Programming in Racket

## Description

This project explores functional programming concepts using the Racket language. The solutions demonstrate the power and flexibility of functional programming by solving various problems in an elegant and concise manner.

## Features

- Implementation of functional programming paradigms.
- Solutions that emphasize immutability and recursion.
- Clean and modular code structure for ease of understanding and extension.
